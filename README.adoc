* This is a desktop application for managing maker spaces. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen through a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java application intended for managing 3-D prints, but has capabilities to handle other forms of manufacturing machines as well.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code that is based on https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[Address Book (level 4)].
* *Features*:
** A GUI for displaying all available machines at a glance.+
** Two different access levels, for two separate target profiles (see below)
** Ability to manipulate prints, queues, and machines, depending on access level
** More test cases, including automated GUI testing.
** Support for _Build Automation_ using Gradle and for _Continuous Integration_ using Travis CI.

* Target user profile:
** There will be two categories of users for the app. The main user will be students using the makerspace. The second user will be the lab manager.

*** has a need to manage a significant number shared devices (lab manager)
*** has a need to prioritize and queue certain print jobs over others (lab manager)
*** has a need to look up when certain devices will be free for use (students)
*** prefers typing over mouse input
*** is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

* *Value proposition*: see 3D printers are being used, and the estimated time left until the equipment will be free. This will reduce system loss and increase the efficiency of all parties involved.
