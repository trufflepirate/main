== Introduction
makerManager is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing prints and other machine jobs in a makerspace. More importantly, makerManager is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, makerManager can get your print and machine management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

* *`listMachine`* : lists all machines
* **`addJob`**`n/iDCP m/TYPrinter on/TIAN YUAN pr/HIGH d/1.5 jn/This is for the iDCP project t/iDCP` : adds a Job named `iDCP` to the MakerManager.
* **`manageJob`**`iDCP start` : starts a Job named `iDCP`
